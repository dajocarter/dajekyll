## What's So Different About It?

The Fresh Fork takes a unique spin on the restaurant scene by having all ordering done online with users picking up their meals at the kitchen or having it delivered. They also have a unique take on their menu. The store offers a different menu for each week, and has at least 3 weekly menus available at all times. So at the end of the week, the current week's menu is removed and a new menu becomes available.

## What Were the Challenges?

The biggest challenges involved syncing the weekly menus and developing the pickup/delivery system.
