  title: WordPress
  text: Since Tribeswell is a WordPress agency, I spend most of my time working with it. I have experience with WooCommerce and the WP REST API. The most common plugins I use are [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](//www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/), [Custom Post Type UI](//github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui/), [Gravity Forms](//www.gravityforms.com/), [WP Migrate DB Pro](//deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/), [Yoast](//yoast.com/).
- url: //scratchtheme.org
  image: "/uploads/site-logo.svg"
  title: Scratch Theme
  text: Built for integration with ACF Pro, Scratch Theme has developed into a boilerplate for Tribeswell. Built with best practices in mind and installed with the most often used libraries by default, it allows for easy manipulation. ACF Pro's Flexible Content custom fields allows for the ability to conserve and use popular layouts.
- url: //gulpjs.com
  image: "/uploads/gulp-2x.png"
  title: Gulp
  text: I replaced Grunt with Gulp as the default take runner in Scratch theme. I use this just about every day with BrowserSync.
- url: #
  image: "/uploads/Sublime_Text_Logo.png"
  title: Sublime Text
  text: Sublime Text has been my default text editor but I've slowly been using Atom more. My current theme is Seti UI and my color scheme is 3024 Night.
- url: #
  image: "/uploads/tower_app.png"
  title: Git Tower
  text: I use the command line a lot for Git but I love the ability to view and select line by line to split a file in different commits. I also like viewing all the colored lines in the commit history.
- url: #
  image: "/uploads/transmit.png"
  title: Transmit
  text: When I have to use FTP, Transmit is the best client hands down.
- url: //jekyllrb.com
  image: "/uploads/logo-2x.png"
  title: Jekyll
  text: This site was built with Jekyll.
- url: //github.com/dajocarter
  image: "/uploads/octocat.png"
  title: GitHub
  text: I use GitHub for my personal projects, but we use BitBucket at work for the **FREE** private repos.
- url: //netlify.com
  image: "/uploads/netlify.png"
  title: Netlify
  text: This is my go-to host for personal projects. I love the ease of use, the ability to add in code like Google Analytics to keep the repo clear, the asset optimization, and the slick Slack notifications among other things. My favorite part is how well integrated it is with Git; you can sync branches with subdomains and get a unique URL preview of each commit.
- url: //facebook.github.io/react
  image: "/uploads/React-icon.png"
  title: React
  text: React is something definitely on my radar for adding to my repetoire. Vue is also something I'd like to get into, but it seems like React is more popular. I've done a few tutorials like a to-do list and Wes Bos's React for Beginners, but I've yet to build anything myself with it.
- url: #
  image: "/uploads/es6.jpg"
  title: ES6
  text: This one goes on my ongoing learning list. I've added babel support to my gulpfile so I can start using some of the new features. Things like `let` and `const` have made it into my vocabulary, but I'm still working on other great features like object destructuring.
- url: //meteor.com
  image: "/uploads/og-image-logo.png"
  title: Meteor
  text: I first discovered Meteor when Blaze was the default UI framework. I went through the first edition of the Discover Meteor tutorial, but haven't followed through since.
- url: //angularjs.org
  image: "/uploads/angular1.png"
  title: Angular 1
  text: When I built a mobile app with the Ionic framework back in 2015, I learned Angular 1.x for the project. I also used it on a small webapp built specifically for the iPad.
- url: //mean.io
  image: "/uploads/Meanstack-624x250.jpg"
  title: MEAN Stack
  text: The MEAN stack has always been on my list to learn, but is just something I haven't got around to yet.
